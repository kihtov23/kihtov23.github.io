What is AutoFixture?
- In simple words AutoFixture is a package which you can add via nuget and use it to simplify your life when writing unit tests.
AutoFixture helps to mock all class dependencies easier. You don't need to mock all services but only those that you need for your method.

My auto fixture github repository with examples is [here](https://github.com/kihtov23/auto-fixture)

You can use my repository to get familiar with main features that AutoFixture provides.
How to learn from my repository?
- Clone [repository](https://github.com/kihtov23/auto-fixture)
- open [UserServiceTests.cs](https://github.com/kihtov23/auto-fixture/blob/main/Tests/UserServiceTests.cs)
and debug each test from top to the bottom
- do the same for [ServiceWithPrimitiveTypesTests.cs](https://github.com/kihtov23/auto-fixture/blob/main/Tests/ServiceWithPrimitiveTypesTests.cs)
